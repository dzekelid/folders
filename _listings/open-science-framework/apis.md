description: OSF provides free and open source project management support for researchers
  across the entire research lifecycle. As a collaboration tool, OSF helps researchers
  work on projects privately with a limited number of collaborators and make parts
  of their projects public, or make all the project publicly accessible for broader
  dissemination. As a workflow system, OSF enables connections to the many services
  researchers already use to streamline their process and increase efficiency. As
  a flexible repository, it can store and archive research data, protocols, and materials.

- name: Open Science Framework List all addon folders
  x-api-slug: open-science-framework
  description: |-
    A paginated list of folders retrieved from the associated third-party (provider) service.
    #### Permissions
    Folders are visible only to the user that authorized the addon.
    #### Returns
    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

    The `data` key contains an array of addon folder objects. Each resource in the array is a separate addon folder object and contains the full representation of the addon folder, meaning additional requests to a addon folder's detail view are not necessary.

    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).
