  service with strong administrative controls and feedback capabilities that improve
  user productivity.Users can comment on files, send them to others for feedback,
  and upload new versions without having to resort to emailing multiple versions of
  their files as attachments. Users can take advantage of these capabilities wherever
  they are, using the device of their choice, including PCs, Macs, tablets and phones.
  Amazon WorkDocs offers IT administrators the option of integrating with existing
  corporate directories, flexible sharing policies and control of the location where
  data is stored. Customers can get started using Amazon WorkDocs with a 30-day free
  trial providing 1 TB of storage per user for up to 50 users.Amazon WorkDocs offers
  an Administrative SDK, currently in public preview. The Administrative SDK allows
  you to integrate your applications with Amazon WorkDocs by performing content and
  permissions updates, and managing users, programmatically. You can sign-up for the
  public preview here.
